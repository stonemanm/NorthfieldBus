# NorthfieldBus

A simple Java program that displays the next time for the bus into Northfield. Designed for Geektool to make my desktop awesome.

**Version:** 1.0.0


## Usage

Compile the java files, then open a shell script in GeekTool and enter the following...

```bash
java -cp path/to/NorthfieldBus NorthfieldBus <location>
```

...where the location is either "town" or "olaf". The output will refer to the next bus leaving in that direction.
